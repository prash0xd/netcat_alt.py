# Python Netcat-Like Utility

Netcat is a versatile networking tool for reading and writing data across networks, making it a valuable asset for various networking tasks. However, security-conscious system administrators often remove Netcat from their systems to prevent potential misuse by attackers. In such cases, having a Python-based alternative can be useful. This repository provides a simple Python network client and server utility inspired by Netcat, allowing you to perform tasks like pushing files, remote command execution, and opening remote shells.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this Python Netcat-like utility is to provide a lightweight, Python-based networking tool for various network-related tasks. Some use cases include:

- Executing remote commands on a target system.
- Transferring files between systems over a network.
- Establishing a remote shell for command-line access.
- Gaining secondary access after breaking into a web application.

This project also serves as a Python programming exercise and demonstrates how to create a basic networking tool using Python's socket and subprocess modules.

## Features

- Basic server and client functionality.
- Remote command execution.
- File upload and download capabilities.
- A simple interactive shell for remote command execution.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use this Python Netcat-like utility:

### Start a listener (server mode) on a specific port:

python netcat.py -l -p 5555

**Connect to the listener (client mode):**
python netcat.py -t 192.168.1.108 -p 5555

**Execute a command on the target:**
python netcat.py -t 192.168.1.108 -p 5555 -e "cat /etc/passwd"

**Upload a file to the target:**
python netcat.py -t 192.168.1.108 -p 5555 -u /path/to/local/file.txt

**Start an interactive shell on the target:**
python netcat.py -t 192.168.1.108 -p 5555 -c

**For more options and details, refer to the command-line help:**
python netcat.py -h
